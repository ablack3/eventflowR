# (In development) Getting data from R into Eventflow

Eventflow is a freely available Java based data visualization tool created at the University of Maryland.

https://hcil.umd.edu/eventflow/


Eventflow expects data in a very specific format outlined in the manual http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/eventflow/manual/ .


This R package contains a function call `write_eventflow()` that makes it easier to write data from R to the format that eventflow understands.
